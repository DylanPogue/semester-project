            Parker Morgan started his business around the age of thirteen.  He began with just a few yards in the surrounding neighborhood and slowly increased his business through word of mouth.  His business now consists of over twenty lawns and has even provided services for certain larger facilities such as Simple Smiles Dental Facility.  Although the majority of his business just consists of general lawncare, such as mowing and weed-eating.  He is also very willing to assist in other projects that you may need assistance with.  An example of this type of project would be clearing out a plot of land to lay down seed.  But this is definitely no the only thing he is willing to help with.
        <br><br>
            If you are questioning his ability to complete a certain project please feel free to check out our contact information and give us a call.  He knows how to use several different kinds of heavy machinery and has worked on a farm for quite some time now.  Here is an example of a project that he worked on recently!

            The reason for creating this website is to hopefully expand his business.  He likes being able to help people and even enjoys doing the work because it makes him feel proud to see what good work he is doing for people.
